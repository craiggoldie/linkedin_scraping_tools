### Guidance Notes

This repository contains code for running the 'LinkedIn Scraping Toolkit' Jupyter notebook.

The notebook is designed to pull all relevant companies for a city/region then view people in those companies whose job titles (or taglines) contain keywords you specify.

The driver is actually still a little buggy (as I've found with other webscraping tasks I've done with a driver). I have added sleep statements and there may be other improvements to get around some of the things that will make it hang at times. However, I was still able to extract hundreds of local relevant employers and view local profiles of potential hiring managers in my speciality.
